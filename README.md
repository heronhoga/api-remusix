# REMUSIX-API
This API provides services to keep the songs that are not widely distributed in major platforms.
you can do CRUD basic operations the songs' data you want to keep in database. You can also find specific song using id as the request parameter. I
tried to implement javascript Web Token for the authorization and authentication method. You can see that the codes still got so many things to improve 
and i hope i can be better on the next projects.

I just wanna learn new things while enjoying my holiday as a computer engineering student. :D
